How can same figure be labelled heavy heavy aliasing and no heavy aliasing I am referring to top left figure where the o/p is four small blocks blue yellow magenta green and same for bottom-right-most in Figure 3?
For the insight into the real benefit of anti-aliasing a detailed figure is necessary.
